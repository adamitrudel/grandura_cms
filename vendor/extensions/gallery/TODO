* pagination for gallery:items:each
* retrieve file doesn't work
* add created_by, updated_by
* Create a flickr gallery.
* Add image for each type of Content-type
* Add credits/licenses for js libraries
* Why when I reorder images, the first one has position=0 instead of 1?. In this way, gallery_item.first? doesn't work!
* If I am inside a gallery tag, I can't use <r:link /> to retrieve page url.
