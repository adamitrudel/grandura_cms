This extension adds a new action ('CopyMove') in the Radiant's administration interface near the 'Add child' button. With this extension you can copy or move a page (and all of its children).

== Requirements

You need the shards extension for this to work for Radiant versions 0.6.6 and under. Versions 0.6.7 and greater have Shards built in.

See http://groups.google.com/group/radiantcms-dev/browse_frm/thread/d07f7fffd84b3ce0/5efa6fd6c2e1668e?lnk=gst&q=shards#5efa6fd6c2e1668e

== Installation

1. Get the latest version of CopyMove extension code:
  
  cd vendor/extensions  
  
	git clone git://github.com/pilu/radiant-copy-move.git copy_move

1.a FOR RADIANT VERSION < 0.6.7

Open the environment.rb and set shards as first extension to be loaded:
  config.extensions = [ :shards, :textile_filter, :markdown_filter, :all ]

1.b FOR RADIANT VERSION >= 0.6.7

Shards is already installed and loaded.

2. From your Rails app root type this command:

  rake RAILS_ENV=production radiant:extensions:copy_move:install

Which will copy some needed files to the public directory of your app.
